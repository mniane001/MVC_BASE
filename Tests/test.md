Given the complexity and variety of testing involved, I'll provide a foundational setup for some of these tests, specifically around the ShoutBox project, and guide you on how you can proceed.

1. Unit Testing:
For ShoutController, you'd want to test individual methods.

// Using PHPUnit
class ShoutControllerTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    public function testListShouts()
    {
        $controller = new ShoutController();
        $result = $controller->listShouts();
        // Assert if the result matches your expectation.
        $this->assertNotEmpty($result);
    }
}


2. Integration Testing:
Test the interaction between ShoutController and Database.

class ShoutIntegrationTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    public function testShoutDatabaseInteraction()
    {
        $controller = new ShoutController();
        $shouts = $controller->listShouts();
        // Assuming you're returning the shouts from listShouts
        $this->assertIsArray($shouts);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('message', $shouts[0]);
    }
}


3. Functional Testing:
Using a tool like Behat, you can write scenarios for how the application should behave.

Feature: Shout listing
  Scenario: Listing all shouts
    Given I am on "/ShoutBox/list-shouts"
    Then I should see "SHOUT IT! shoutbox"

4. Acceptance Testing:
Again, a tool like Behat can be used:

Feature: Shout creation
  Scenario: Submitting a shout
    Given I am on "/ShoutBox"
    When I fill in "user" with "John"
    And I fill in "message" with "Hello!"
    And I press "Shout it out"
    Then I should see "Shout submitted successfully"


5. Performance Testing:
Use JMeter to simulate multiple users accessing the /ShoutBox/list-shouts URL and measure response times.

6. Security Testing:
Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities:

$message = "test'); DROP TABLE shouts; --";
$controller = new ShoutController();
$controller->processForm($message);
// Now check if the `shouts` table still exists.


7. Usability Testing:
This is more subjective and involves getting real users to use your application and gather feedback.

8. Compatibility Testing:
You'd need to use tools or platforms like BrowserStack to test your ShoutBox across different browsers.

9. Smoke Testing:
A simple test to see if the application loads:

$controller = new ShoutController();
$this->assertNotNull($controller);

10. Database Testing:
Check if the data is correctly saved in the database after a shout is processed.

11. Exploratory Testing:
Manually try different combinations of input to see if you can "break" the application or find unexpected behavior.
